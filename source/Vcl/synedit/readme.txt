How this package was hacked together:

- Download the Mystix source file 'Mystix031Src.zip' and extract its SynEdit portion to Source\.
- Download the SynEdit 2.0.6 source and extract its packages to Packages\.
- Add SynEditReg.dcr, SynEdit.res and SynEdit.inc from SynEdit 2.0.6 to Source\.
- Add the SynAutoIndent files (they're from an older version of SynEdit).
- Then modify the Mystix source at the places marked by // Orwell Mod
