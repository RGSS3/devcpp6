1) Install the following packages by double clicking them and clicking on compile and/or install:

Source\VCL\DevCpp.dpk
Source\VCL\SynEditPackages\SynEdit_D7.dpk
Source\VCL\ClassBrowsing\ClassBrowsing.dpk

2) Compile resources: run Source\CompileResources.bat to create binary .res files.

3) Opening and using the main project file 'devcpp.dpr' should not bring up any 'Module Not Found' errors now.

4) Other versions of Delphi should work, but I've only tested Delphi 7.
